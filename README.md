Interactive 3D Solar System Navigation Simulator
Overview
This project is an interactive 3D simulation of the solar system, built using Three.js. It allows users to explore the solar system, view planets and their moons, observe the asteroid belt, and plan and visualize trajectories for space missions. The simulator includes intuitive controls for adjusting the scale, changing views, and simulating historical space missions, making it both an educational tool and a visually engaging experience.

Features
Realistic Orbits: Planets and moons follow elliptical orbits based on real astronomical data, scaled proportionally.
Scale Adjustment: Dynamically adjust the scale of the solar system (0.1x to 10x) for better visualization.
Multiple Views: Switch between heliocentric (Sun-centered), geocentric (Earth-centered), or planet-centric views for Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, or Neptune.
Trajectory Planning: Plan and visualize custom space trajectories by setting launch velocity (10 to 100 km/s) and angle (0° to 360°).
Historical Missions: Load and visualize simplified trajectories of famous space missions, including Apollo 11, Voyager 1, Voyager 2, and more.
Interactive Controls: Play, pause, and adjust the simulation speed (0.1x to 10x), with options to fast-forward or slow down.
Asteroid Belt: A visually appealing representation of the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, with over 4,000 asteroids.
Fullscreen Mode: Toggle fullscreen for an immersive experience.
Starfield Background: A randomized starfield enhances the cosmic ambiance.
Setup
To run the simulator, follow these steps:
Download the Project:
Alternatively, download the project files as a ZIP and extract them.
Open the HTML File:
Navigate to the project directory and open index.html in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
Note: Due to browser security restrictions (e.g., CORS), some features may not work correctly when opening the file directly (via file://). To resolve this, run the project on a local web server.
